# NIST 800-53 Assessment

The following table provides a self-assessment of Tanzu Application Platform against the
NIST SP 800-53r4 moderate baseline. This translates to FISMA Moderate and CNSSI 1253 Mod/Mod/Mod for
use in US Federal systems accreditation. The Moderate baseline applies to only technical controls.
Organizational policy controls, physical security, media policies, and similar
are excluded as they are not applicable to Tanzu Application Platform. These excluded
controls are still relevant to the system at large and must be inherited from existing accreditations
or otherwise addressed.

The initial iteration of this assessment delineates responsible parties.
Incremental updates will add more details on implementation and update to 800-53 Revision 5.
