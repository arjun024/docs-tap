# Out of the Box Templates

Templates stamp out kubernetes objects based on configuration in the workload, supply
chain (tap values), and results output from other templated objects. A supply chain organizes
a set of templates into a directed acyclic graph. This package contains templates that are used
by the Out of the Box Supply Chains and the Out of the Box Delivery. As a prerequisite of the
Out of the Box Supply Chains, you must install this package to have Workloads delivered properly.

Read the [Template Reference](ootb-template-reference.html) for details on each template provided.
