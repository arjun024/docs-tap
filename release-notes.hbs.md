### <a id='1-6-0-new-features'></a> New features by component and area

This release includes the following changes, listed by component and area.

#### <a id='1-6-0-flux-sc'></a> FluxCD Source Controller

Flux Source Controller v0.36.1-build.2 release includes the following API changes:

- `GitRepository` API

    - `spec.ref.name` is the reference value for Git checkout. It takes precedence over Branch,
    Tag and SemVer, It must be a valid
    [Git reference](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-check-ref-format#_description).

        Examples:

        - `"refs/heads/main"`
        - `"refs/tags/v0.1.0"`
        - `"refs/pull/420/head"`
        - `"refs/merge-requests/1/head"`

    - `status.artifact.digest` represents the value of the file in the form of `ALGORITHM:CHECKSUM`.
    - `status.observedIgnore` represents the latest `spec.ignore` value. It indicates the ignore
    rules for building the current artifact in storage.
    - `status.observedRecurseSubmodules` represents the latest `spec.recurseSubmodules` value
    during the latest reconciliation.
    - `status.observedInclude` represents the list of `GitRepository` resources that produces
    the current artifact.

- `OCIRepository` API

    - `spec.layerSelector` specifies which layer is extracted from an OCI Artifact.
    This field is optional and set to extracting the first layer in the artifact by default.
    - `spec.verify` includes the secret name that holds the trusted public keys for signature verification.
    It also indicates the provider responsible for validating the authenticity of the OCI image.
    - `spec.insecure` enables connections to a non-TLS HTTP container image registry.

- `HelmChart` API

    - Add the new field `spec.verify`, which includes the secret name that holds
    the trusted public keys for signature verification.
    It also indicates the provider responsible for validating the authenticity of the OCI image.
    This field is only supported when using the HelmRepository source with the `spec.type` OCI.
    Chart dependencies, which are not bundled in the umbrella chart artifact, are not verified.

- `HelmRepository` API

    - Add the new field `spec.provider` for authentication purposes. Supported values are
    `aws`, `azure`, `gcp` or `generic`.
    `generic` is its default value. This field is only required when the `.spec.type` field is set to `oci`

- `Bucket` API

    - Add the new field `status.observedIgnore` which represents the latest `spec.ignore` value.
    It indicates the ignore rules for building the current artifact in storage.

#### <a id='1-6-0-appsso'></a> Application Single Sign-On (AppSSO)

- Incorporate the token expiry settings into the `AuthServer` resource. Service
  operators can customize the expiry settings of access, refresh or identity
  token. For more information, see [Token
  settings](./app-sso/tutorials/service-operators/token-settings.hbs.md#token-expiry-settings).
- Enable the capability to:
    - Map custom user attributes or claims from upstream identity providers,
      such as OpenID, LDAP, and SAML.
    - Configure the internal unsafe provider with custom claims out of the box.
      For more information, see [identity
      providers](./app-sso/tutorials/service-operators/identity-providers.hbs.md#id-token-claims-mapping).
- `ClusterUnsafeTestLogin` is an unsafe, ready-to-claim AppSSO service offering
- `ClusterWorkloadRegistrationClass` exposes an `AuthServer` as a
  ready-to-claim AppSSO service offering
- `WorkloadRegistration` is portable client registration which templates
  redirect URIs
- `XWorkloadRegistration` is an XRD and an integration API between Services
  Toolkit, Crossplane and AppSSO

#### <a id='1-6-0-scst-store'></a> Supply Chain Security Tools - Store

- New report feature that links all packages, vulnerabilities, and ratings
  associated from a specific vulnerability scan SBOM to a Store report. When
  querying a report, it returns information linked to the original SBOM report
  instead of returning the aggregated data of all reports for the linked image
  or source.
  - `POST /api/v1/images` and `POST /api/v1/sources` APIs updated
    - New optional header request fields:
      - `Report-UID`: A unique identifier to assign to the report. If omitted, a
        unique identifier is randomly generated for the report. Supported
        characters: ALPHA DIGIT "-" / "." / "_" / "~".
      - `Original-Location`: The stored location of the original SBOM
        vulnerability scan result used to create this report.
    - New response field returned `ReportUID`, the report's unique identifier
      associated with the data submitted by this image.
  - `POST /api/v1/artifact-groups` API updated
    - New `ReportUID` optional body payload field which links an existing
      report, tagged by its UID, to this artifact group
  - New `GET /api/v1/report/{ReportUID}` API gets a specific report by its
    unique identifier.
  - New `GET /api/v1/reports` API queries for a list of reports with specified
    image digest, source SHA, or original location.
    - **Note**: When you request SPDX or CycloneDX format, the report date is
      set to the date of the original vulnerability scan SBOM. In addition, the
      tooling section includes the tool used to generate the original
      vulnerability scan report, if provided, and SCST - Store.

### <a id='1-6-0-breaking-changes'></a> Breaking changes

This release includes the following changes, listed by component and area.

#### <a id='1-6-0-COMPONENT-NAME-bc'></a> COMPONENT-NAME

- Breaking change description.

#### <a id='1-6-0-appsso-bc'></a> Application Single Sign-On (AppSSO)

- The recommendation is to consume AppSSO service offerings via `ClassClaim`
  instead of the lower-level `WorkloadRegistration` or `ClientRegistration`.
- Crossplane is an installation- and runtime dependency of AppSSO
- The field `AuthServer.spec.tls.disabled` is removed. Use
  `AuthServer.spec.tls.deactivated` instead.
- The field `ClientRegistration.spec.redirectURIs` is no longer defaulted to
  `["http://127.0.0.0:8080"]`.

#### <a id='1-6-0-flux-sc-bc'></a> FluxCD Source Controller

- The format of the `status.artifact.revision` value in the `GitRepository` resource's
  status field is updated from `BRANCH/CHECKSUM` to `BRANCH@sha1:CHECKSUM`.
    - Example: `main/6db88c7a7e7dec1843809b058195b68480c4c12a` to `main@sha1:6db88c7a7e7dec1843809b058195b68480c4c12a`.

#### <a id='1-6-0-buildservice-bc'></a> Tanzu Build Service

  - You must remove existing full dependencies installations before installing the new version.
  - You must provide the tap-values file during the full dependencies package installation.
- The full dependencies package repository is tagged with the Tanzu Application Platform package version instead of the Tanzu Build Service package version.
- The Ubuntu Bionic stack is no longer shipped in Tanzu Application Platform and the Full Dependencies Package Repository.

### <a id='1-6-0-security-fixes'></a> Security fixes

This release has the following security fixes, listed by component and area.

#### <a id='1-6-0-COMPONENT-NAME-fixes'></a> COMPONENT-NAME

- Security fix description.

---

### <a id='1-6-0-resolved-issues'></a> Resolved issues

The following issues, listed by component and area, are resolved in this release.

#### <a id='1-6-0-COMPONENT-NAME-ri'></a> COMPONENT-NAME

- Resolved issue description.

#### <a id='1-6-0-stk-ri'></a> Services Toolkit (STK)

- Resolved an issue which prevented the default cluster-admin IAM role on GKE clusters from claiming any of the Bitnami Services
  - Previously, if a user with cluster-admin on a GKE cluster attempted to claim any of the bitnami services, they would be met with a validation error
  - This issue has now been resolved
- Resolved an issue affecting the dynamic provisioning flow when attempting to use a CompositeResourceDefinition which specified a schema which only defined .status without also defining .spec
  - Previously, if attempting to create a ClassClaim for a ClusterInstanceClass which referred to such a CompositeResourceDefinition, the ClassClaim would not transition into Ready=True and would instead report, "unexpected end of JSON input"
  - This issue has now been resolved and thus it is now possible to use CompositeResourceDefinitions which only specify .status in their schemas

#### <a id='1-6-0-crossplane-ri'></a> Crossplane

- The Crossplane Package will now more gracefully handle situations in which Crossplane is already installed to a cluster via some out of band mechanism (e.g. Helm install)
  - Previously the Crossplane Package (which ships as part of the Full, Iterate and Run TAP profiles) assumed that Crossplane was not already installed on the cluster, which is not always guaranteed to be true
  - Rather than fail installation, the Package installation would move ahead and try to succeed, which would result in non-deterministic behaviour
  - Now, any attempt to install or upgrade to the Crossplane Package on a cluster which already has Crossplane installed will fail the installation with the following error, "Resource already exists. Consider excluding package in tap-values."
  - In such cases, the operator then has two options
    - 1). Exclude the crossplane Package in the tap-values file
    - 2). Choose to set the crossplane Package's adopt_resources value to true

### <a id='1-6-0-known-issues'></a> Known issues

This release has the following known issues, listed by component and area.

#### <a id='1-6-0-tap-gui-ki'></a> Tanzu Application Platform GUI

- Ad-blocking browser extensions and standalone ad-blocking software can interfere with telemetry
  collection within the VMware
  [Customer Experience Improvement Program](https://www.vmware.com/solutions/trustvmware/ceip.html)
  and restrict access to all or parts of Tanzu Application Platform GUI.
  For more information, see [Troubleshooting](tap-gui/troubleshooting.hbs.md#ad-block-interference).

#### <a id='1-6-0-scc-ki'></a> Supply Chain Choreographer

- If the size of the resulting OpenAPIv3 specification exceeds a certain size, roughly 3KB, the Supply Chain does not function. If the operator is using the default Carvel Package parameters, they are fine with this value enabled. If they use custom Carvel Package parameters, they might run into this size limit. If they exceed the size limit, they can either deactivate this feature, or use a workaround. The workaround requires enabling a Tekton feature flag. See the [Tekton documentation](https://tekton.dev/docs/pipelines/additional-configs/#enabling-larger-results-using-sidecar-logs).
