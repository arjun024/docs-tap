### <a id='1-2-2-known-issues'></a> Known issues

This release has the following known issues, listed by area and component.

#### <a id="1-2-2-upgrade-issues"></a> Upgrading Tanzu Application Platform

- **Adding the v1.2.2 repository bundle in addition to another repository might cause a failure:**

   - While upgrading to Tanzu Application Platform v1.2.2 from any previous version, adding the v1.2.2 repo bundle in addition to the existing repo bundle can fail. For the workaround, see [Troubleshoot installing Tanzu Application Platform](troubleshooting-tap/troubleshoot-install-tap.hbs.md#tap-upgrade-fails).

  - You might observe an error with package installs `ReconcileFailed True Expected to find at least one version` until Tanzu Application Platform is upgraded to v1.2.2, but this does not affect the functionality of any components.

#### <a id="1-2-2-grype-scan-issues"></a>Grype scanner

- **Scanning Java source code that uses Gradle package manager may not reveal vulnerabilities:**

  - For most languages, source code scanning only scans files present in the source code repository.
    Except for support added for Java projects using Maven, no network calls are made to fetch dependencies.
    For languages using dependency lock files, such as Golang and Node.js,
    Grype uses the lock files to check the dependencies for vulnerabilities.
  - For Java using Gradle, dependency lock files are not guaranteed, so Grype uses
    the dependencies present in the built binaries (`.jar` or `.war` files) instead.
  - Because VMware does not encourage committing binaries to source code repositories,
    Grype fails to find vulnerabilities during a source scan.
    The vulnerabilities are still found during the image scan
    after the binaries are built and packaged as images.

#### <a id="1-2-2-scst-sign-issues"></a>Supply Chain Security Tools - Policy Controller

This issue is also present in previous releases of Supply Chain Security Tools - Policy Controller.

- **`kubectl run` pods fail to validate in non-default namespaces:**

  - When policy verification occurs on an image deployed through `kubectl run` on a non-default namespace, the verification will fail to create the keychain required if the image requires credentials.

#### <a id="1-2-2-learning-center-issues"></a>Learning Center

- **session.objects, environment.objects, and session.patches are not deployed:**

  - Due to a security improvement in Learning Center, session.objects, environment.objects, and session.patches are not working properly. VMware resolved this issue by Learning Center `v0.2.4` in TAP 1.3.2.

## <a id='1-2-1'></a> v1.2.1

**Release Date**: August 9, 2022

### <a id='1-2-1-new-features'></a> New features

This release includes the following changes, listed by component and area.

#### <a id="1-2-1-tbs-features"></a> Tanzu Build Service

- Improved error messaging.
- Removed noisy logging from AWS credential helper.

### <a id='1-2-1-resolved'></a> Resolved issues

The following issues, listed by area and component, are resolved in this release.

#### <a id="1-2-1-tap-gui-resolved"></a>Tanzu Application Platform GUI

- Supply Chain plug-in:
  - ConfigMap has no conditions and as a result its status is `Unknown`.
  - ConfigWriter shows an error but no error details are displayed.
  - Kaniko-based image builds cannot show data in the UI.
  - Need to refresh browser to show successful or error messages.

- Runtime Resource Visibility plug-in:
The [Maven artifacts access error](tap-gui/troubleshooting.hbs.md#maven-artifacts-error) is fixed.

### <a id='1-2-1-known-issues'></a> Known issues

This release has the following known issues, listed by area and component.

#### <a id="1-2-1-tap-known-issues"></a>Tanzu Application Platform

- **Unable to add Tanzu Application Platform repo into clusters attached to Tanzu Mission Control with pre-installed Cluster Essentials v1.2:** For the solution, see [Troubleshoot installing Tanzu Application Platform](troubleshooting-tap/troubleshoot-install-tap.hbs.md#cant-add-tap-repo).

#### <a id="1-2-1-scst-scan-issues"></a>Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan

- **Blob source scan is reporting wrong source URL:** When running a source scan of a blob compressed file, it looks for a `.git` directory present in the files to extract information that is useful for the report sent to the Supply Chain Security Tools - Store deployment. This problem happens when you use Grype Scanner ScanTemplates earlier than version `v1.2.0` because the Scan Controller has a deprecated path to support previous ScanTemplates. VMware plans to resolve this issue by Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan `v1.3.0`. For the solution, see [Observability and troubleshooting](scst-scan/observing.hbs.md#reporting-wrong-blob-url).

#### <a id="1-2-1-grype-scan-issues"></a>Grype scanner

- **Scanning Java source code that uses Gradle package manager may not reveal vulnerabilities:**
  - For most languages, source code scanning only scans files present in the source code repository.
    Except for support added for Java projects using Maven, no network calls are made to fetch dependencies.
    For languages using dependency lock files, such as Golang and Node.js,
    Grype uses the lock files to check the dependencies for vulnerabilities.
  - For Java using Gradle, dependency lock files are not guaranteed, so Grype uses
    the dependencies present in the built binaries (`.jar` or `.war` files) instead.
  - Because VMware does not encourage committing binaries to source code repositories,
    Grype fails to find vulnerabilities during a source scan.
    The vulnerabilities are still found during the image scan
    after the binaries are built and packaged as images.

  - Surfaces information about the health of resources directly on the owner status.
  - Adds a field in the spec `healthRule` where authors can specify how to determine the health of the underlying resource for that template. The resource can be in one of the following states: A stamped resource can be in one of three states: `Healthy` (status True), `Unhealthy` (status False), or `Unknown` (status Unknown). If no healthRule is defined, Cartographer defaults to listing the resource as `Healthy` once it is successfully applied to the cluster and any outputs are read off the resource.
- [Cartographer Conventions](./cartographer-conventions/about.md) v0.1.0 is now bundled with Supply Chain Choreographer.
  - As of v0.07.0 release of [Convention Controller](./convention-service/about.md), its APIs are deprecated in favor of continuing development on [Cartographer Conventions](./cartographer-conventions/about.md). Cartographer Conventions is now bundled with Supply Chain Choreographer.

#### <a id="scst-scan-features"></a> Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan

#### <a id="tbs-features"></a> Tanzu Build Service

- Updates to dependencies are now provided as part of Tanzu Application Platform patches.
- The automatic dependency update feature is deprecated.
VMware discourages configuring Tanzu Application Platform with automatic dependency updates due to compatibility risks.
This feature is still supported until stated otherwise.

#### <a id="srvc-toolkit-features"></a> Services Toolkit

- Services Toolkit now integrates with Amazon RDS using the ACK Operator or Crossplane.
For more information, see the [Services Toolkit documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/Services-Toolkit-for-VMware-Tanzu-Application-Platform/0.7/svc-tlk/GUID-use.html).
- New `ClusterInstanceClass` supports service instance abstraction.

`tanzu service type` and `tanzu service instance` from now on.

### <a id='1-2-breaking-changes'></a> Breaking changes

This release has the following breaking changes, listed by area and component.

#### <a id="app-accel-changes"></a> Application Accelerator

- App Accelerator now ships with Open Rewrite 7.24.0 (up from 7.21.x in TAP 1.1). As a consequence, some configuration properties of the OpenRewriteRecipe transform may need to be revised. For example, when using the `ChangePackage` recipe.

#### <a id="scst-scan-changes"></a> Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan

- You must configure integration with Supply Chain Security Tools - Store for the Grype Scanner and Snyk Scanner packages to enable this feature. The configuration for Supply Chain Security Tools - Store in Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan is only for the deprecated Grype Scanner `ScanTemplate`s.
- For the profile configuration of Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan, the scanning component no longer takes the metadata store configurations as of v1.2.0.
  - For information about configuring metadata store by using the Grype component instead of the scanning component as of v1.2.0, see [Install multicluster Tanzu Application Platform profiles
](multicluster/installing-multicluster.md).
  - See [Build profile](multicluster/reference/tap-values-build-sample.md) for the deprecated way of writing the metadata store configuration through the scanning component.

  >**Note:** This doesn't apply if you are using the deprecated Grype Scanner `ScanTemplate`s prior to Grype Scanner `v1.2.0`.

  - The package name changed from `package policies` to `package main`.
  - The deny rule changed from the boolean `isCompliant` to the array of strings `deny[msg]`.
  - The sample `ScanPolicy` is different if you're using Grype Scanner with a CycloneDX structure or Snyk Scanner with a SPDX JSON structure. See [Install Snyk Scanner](scst-scan/install-snyk-integration.md) for an example of a Scan Policy.
  - See [Enforce compliance policy using Open Policy Agent](scst-scan/policies.md) for an example of the current ScanPolicy format for v1.2.0 and later.

#### <a id="tbs-breaking-changes"></a> Tanzu Build Service

>**Note:** If your Tanzu Application Platform v1.1 installation is configured with
`enable_automatic_updates: false`, you can ignore this breaking change.

- When upgrading Tanzu Application Platform to v1.2, Tanzu Build Service image
resources automatically run a build that fails due to a missing dependency.
This error does not persist and subsequent builds automatically resolve this error.
Users can safely wait for the next build of their workloads, which is triggered
by source code changes.
To manually re-run builds, follow the instructions in the troubleshooting item
[Builds fail after upgrading to Tanzu Application Platform v1.2](tanzu-build-service/troubleshooting.hbs.md#tbs-1-3-5-breaking-change).

#### <a id="grype-scanner-changes"></a> Grype Scanner

- Provide information to integrate with the Supply Chain Security Tools - Store in the `tap-values.yaml` file for the Grype Scanner v1.2 and later.

#### <a id="srvc-toolkit-resolved"></a> Services Toolkit

- ResourceClaims no longer mutate service resources with an annotation to mark a claimed resource.
- ResourceClaims no longer require the `update` permission when adding new service resources to Tanzu Application Platform.

#### <a id="srvc-bindings-resolved"></a> Service Bindings

- Added a new ClusterRole `service-binding-provisioned-services`  with label selector `servicebinding.io/controller: "true"` for get, list, and watch, which fixes the issue where Service Binding controller was aggregating non-provisioned service RBAC to the controller manager.

#### <a id="sprng-convs-resolved"></a> Spring Boot Conventions

- No environment variables are added if conventions are not applied. Fixes the issue where `JAVA_TOOL_OPTS` was added to non-JAVA apps.

  appear as expected.

### <a id='1-2-known-issues'></a> Known issues

This release has the following known issues, listed by area and component.

#### <a id="tap-known-issues"></a>Tanzu Application Platform

- **Failure to connect to AWS EKS clusters:**
When connecting to AWS EKS clusters, an error might appear with the text
`Error: Unable to connect: connection refused. Confirm kubeconfig details and try again` or
`invalid apiVersion "client.authentication.k8s.io/v1alpha1"`.
To prevent this, see
[Failure to connect to AWS EKS clusters](troubleshooting-tap/troubleshoot-using-tap.md#connect-aws-eks-clusters).

- **Failure to add Tanzu Application Platform repo:**
Unable to add Tanzu Application Platform repo into clusters attached
to Tanzu Mission Control with pre-installed Cluster Essentials v1.2. For the solution, see [Troubleshoot installing Tanzu Application Platform](troubleshooting-tap/troubleshoot-install-tap.hbs.md#cant-add-tap-repo).

#### <a id="alv-known-issues"></a>Application Live View

- Application Live View with custom CA does not support air-gapped installation.

#### <a id="alv-ca-known-issues"></a>Application Single Sign-On

- Application Single Sign-On with custom CA does not support air-gapped installation.

#### <a id="conv-svc-known-issues"></a>Convention Service

- **Issue:**
  If the self-signed certificate authority (CA) for a registry is provided through `convention-controller.ca_cert_data`, it is not successfully propagated to the convention service. For the solution, see [Troubleshoot Convention Service](cartographer-conventions/troubleshooting.hbs.md#ca-not-propagated).

#### <a id="functions-issues"></a> Functions (beta)

- When using Live Update, hot reload of your function on your cluster might not
display changes made to your function.
To manually push changes to the cluster, run the `tilt up` command.

#### <a id="scst-scan-issues"></a>Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan

- **Blob Source Scan is reporting wrong source URL:**
When running a Source Scan of a blob compressed file, it looks for a `.git` directory present in the files to extract information that is usefull for the report sent to the Supply Chain Security Tools - Store deployment. This problem happens when you use Grype Scanner ScanTemplates earlier than version `v1.2.0` because the Scan Controller has a deprecated path to support previous ScanTemplates. This will be removed by Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan `v1.3.0`. For the solution, see [Observability and troubleshooting](scst-scan/observing.hbs.md#reporting-wrong-blob-url).

#### <a id="grype-scan-known-issues"></a>Grype scanner

- **Scanning Java source code that uses Gradle package manager may not reveal vulnerabilities:**
  - For most languages, Source Code Scanning only scans files present in the source code repository.
    Except for support added for Java projects using Maven, no network calls are made to fetch dependencies.
    For languages using dependency lock files, such as Golang and Node.js,
    Grype uses the lock files to check the dependencies for vulnerabilities.
  - For Java using Gradle, dependency lock files are not guaranteed, so Grype uses
    the dependencies present in the built binaries (`.jar` or `.war` files) instead.
  - Because VMware does not encourage committing binaries to source code repositories,
    Grype fails to find vulnerabilities during a Source Scan.
    The vulnerabilities are still found during the Image Scan
    after the binaries are built and packaged as images.

#### <a id="tap-gui-known-issues"></a>Tanzu Application Platform GUI

- **Tanzu Application Platform GUI doesn't work in Safari:**
  Tanzu Application Platform GUI does not work in the Safari web browser.

- **Supply Chain plug-in:**

    - The delivery section of the supply chain graph might show deliverables that do not pertain to
      the selected workload. This occurs if there is more than one `Build` cluster per namespace.
    - For `Deliverables` to show up for a `Workload`, they must have the following labels in both
      resources: `carto.run/workload-name`, `app.kubernetes.io/part-of`, and `carto.run/supply-chain-name`.
    - ConfigMap has no conditions and as a result its status is `Unknown`.
    - ConfigWriter shows an error but no error details are displayed.
    - You might receive the error `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'data')`
      when viewing a workload in a supply chain.
      Use the CLI tools instead to view the status of the workload in the supply chain.

- **Back-end Kubernetes plug-in reporting failure in multicluster environments:**

  In a multicluster environment when one request to a Kubernetes cluster fails,
  `backstage-kubernetes-backend` reports a failure to the front end.
  This is a known issue with upstream Backstage and it applies to all released versions of
  Tanzu Application Platform GUI. For more information, see
  [this Backstage code in GitHub](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/c7f88d041b671185dc7a01e716f80dca0709e2a1/plugins/kubernetes-backend/src/service/KubernetesFanOutHandler.ts#L250-L271).
  This behavior arises from the API at the Backstage level. There are currently no known workarounds.
  There are plans for upstream commits to Backstage to resolve this issue.

- **Runtime Resource Visibility plug-in:**
  When accessing the **Runtime Resources** tab from the **Component** view, the following warning appears:
  `Access error when querying cluster 'host' for resource '/apis/source.apps.tanzu.vmware.com/v1alpha1/mavenartifacts' (status: 403). Contact your administrator.`
  This issue is resolved in v1.2.1. In v1.2.0, the user can fix this issue by troubleshooting the

- **Debugging ending prematurely:**
  When debugging an application with service bindings, debugging sessions might prematurely end on
  the first run only. This is because of services being late-bound.

- **Workload panel only supports `kubeconfig`:**
  The workload panel only supports the default `kubeconfig` file, which is usually in `~/.kube/config`.

- **Unable to view workloads on the panel when connected to GKE cluster:**
  When connecting to Google's GKE clusters, an error might appear with the text
  `WARNING: the gcp auth plugin is deprecated in v1.22+, unavailable in v1.25+; use gcloud instead.`
  To fix this, see [Troubleshooting](vscode-extension/troubleshooting.hbs.md#cannot-view-workloads).

- **Warning notification when canceling an action:**
  A warning notification can appear when running `Tanzu: Debug Start`, `Tanzu: Live Update Start`,
  or `Tanzu: Apply`, which says that no workloads or Tiltfiles were found.
  For more information, see [Troubleshooting](vscode-extension/troubleshooting.hbs.md#cancel-action-warning).

- **Live update might not work when using server or worker Workload types:**
  When using `server` or `worker` as
  [workload type](workloads/workload-types.hbs.md#-available-workload-types),
  live update might not work.
  For more information, see
  [Troubleshooting](vscode-extension/troubleshooting.hbs.md#lu-not-working-wl-types)

- Querying by insight source returns zero CVEs even though there are CVEs in the source scan:
When attempting to look up CVE and affected packages, querying `insight source get` (or other
`insight source` commands) may return zero results due to supply chain configuration and repo URL.
