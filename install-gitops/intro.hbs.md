# Install Tanzu Application Platform (GitOps)

GitOps is an operational framework that uses Git repositories as a single source of truth.
Under GitOps, you describe the desired state of a Tanzu Application Platform (commonly known as TAP) 
configuration by using a declarative specification and place it in your Git repository.

>**Caution** Tanzu Application Platform (GitOps) is currently in beta and is intended for evaluation and test purposes only. Do not use in a production environment.
